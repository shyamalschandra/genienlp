The voice of Nicholas's young son, Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich, narrates the

a young Grigori Rasputin is asked by his father and a group of men to perform magic.
Rasputin has a vision and denounces one of the men as a horse thief. Although his
father initially slaps him for making such an accusation, Rasputin watches as the
